I am currently a staff researcher in the Energy-Water Systems Integration department at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/); I also completed my postdoc here. My current work focuses on hazard impacts to the grid and renewable energy production. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in civil engineering under [Megan Konar](http://mkonar.cee.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, my work focused on understanding the interaction and response of agricultural trade to extreme climate events such as temperature extrema, heavy rain, and drought

My overarching research goal is to advance the resiliency of critical infrastructure to extreme weather events and natural hazards. In particular, my research seeks to:

<ol>
<li> ** understand ** the context under which extreme weather and natural hazards occur </li>
<li> **improve** the characterization of these events both historically and under future climate scenarios </li>
<li> ** quantify **  impacts to critical infrastructure from hazards via integrated assessments </li> 
</ol>
To do so, my work blends data science, climate science, econometrics, and risk management to develop new analytical and systems-based approaches to increase resiliency and lessen vulnerability  xxxxxx critical infrastructure systems. .
