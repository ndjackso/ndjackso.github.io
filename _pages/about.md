I am currently a staff researcher in the [Energy-Water Systems Integration](https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/energy-water/) department at within the Climate Security Center at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/); I also completed my postdoc here. My current work focuses on hazard impacts to energy, water, and food systems. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in civil engineering under the mentorship of [Megan Konar](http://mkonar.cee.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, my work focused on understanding the interaction and response of agricultural trade to extreme weather events such as temperature extrema, heavy rain, and drought.

My overarching research goal is to advance the security, reliability, and resilience of critical infrastructure to extreme events, spanning both physical- (i.e., weather and natural hazards) and cyber-related threats. In particular, my research seeks to:

<ol>
<li> understand the context under which event events occur </li>
<li> improve the characterization of these events both historically and under future scenarios </li>
<li> quantify  impacts to critical infrastructure from hazards via integrated assessments </li> 
</ol>

To do so, my work blends data science, climate science, econometrics, and risk management to develop new analytical and systems-based approaches.
